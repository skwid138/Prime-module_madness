# Module Madness

In this challenge, you will need to spin up a new project (much like we did in lecture). You will create three modules as specified below, create a *server.js* that will use these modules!

## Modules
###Module One
The first module will **export** a function that returns a random number after taking in a min and max value as arguments (hint: you can use random number functions from previous assignments). When you call this module, use `100` as your min, and `1000000` as your max.

###Module Two
The second module should accept a number and convert it to a USD value. You can find some good implementations of this online.
 
###Module Three
The third module should **require** the other two modules (i.e. Module One and Module Two). It should have two function `exports`:

1. The first function **export** should return the result of the first module being passed into the second module. 
2. The second function **export** should return the text “Account balance: \n”.

## server.js
Finally, in the `server.js` file use the functions from your third module to produce the following output when you visit *http://localhost:3000* in your browser:

```
Account balance:
$156,301
```
